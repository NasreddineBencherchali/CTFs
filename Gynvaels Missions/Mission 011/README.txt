Finally some real work!

One of our field agents managed to infiltrate suspects hideout and steal a
pendrive possibly containing important information. However, the pendrive
actually requires one to authenticate themselves before accessing the stored
files.

We gave the pendrive to our laboratory and they managed to dump the firmware. We
looked at the deadlisting they sent and for our best knowledge it's some form of
Elvish. We can't read it.

Here is the firmware: goo.gl/axsAHt

And off you go. Bring us back the password.

Good luck!
